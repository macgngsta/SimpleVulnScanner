# Simple Vulnerability Scanner (v0.0.1)

This idea was the result of having to complete a final project for Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis.

The concept is simple, take a folder full of code and perform static analysis to find security vulnerabilities.

The scope of this project will be pretty narrow. I'm going to specifically focus on SQL injection and operate with the language php and examine for the majority Wordpress Plugins.

The workflow:
* read in the folder of code
* run through all the code/files and update relationships in a graph database (neo4j)
* run queries on the database looking for specific signatures
* print a report of all findings
